Hello dear reader, this time I don't have much words, but instead I want to share some code I haven't shared for a long.

A few years ago, I had a work pause and got some time to make some courses, checking priorities and decision making.

On 2015 after getting a last paycheck for a project, I found this great [Kadenze platform](https://www.kadenze.com) and this [great course from the Processing foundation](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/the-nature-of-code-ii/info).

The visualizations can be found hosted [here](https://raze.mx/maquetacion/nature-of-code/index.html) and the code [here](https://github.com/razeone/nature-of-code).

Feel free to make some clicks when visualizing, moving the mouse or trying to interact with some of the scenarios, more information on GitHub repo, also changing the code is so funny.

I'll share a video as well for the visualizations just below:

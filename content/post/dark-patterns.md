Firstly I'd like to apologize for being so salty on thi blog lately. Since I deleted my Twitter account earlier on this year, I miss to spread my salt around so I'm using this blog now, however, I'm hoping this is not only my personal opinion but also a place to share ideas with people.

Having said that, I want to start by defining what a Dark Pattern is:

[According to The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/29/4640308/dark-patterns-inside-the-interfaces-designed-to-trick-you), they are interfaces designed to trick you. In words of [Harry Brignull](https://www.brignull.com/), they are like a [Roach Motel](https://www.darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/roach-motel): >> The design makes it very easy for you to get into a certain situation, but then makes it hard for you to get out of it (e.g. a subscription). Harry is also the founder of [Dark Patterns](https://www.darkpatterns.org/) which is dedicated to "naming and shaming websites that use deceptive user interfaces".

Also, [darkpatterns.org](https://www.darkpatterns.org/) identifies several types of dark patterns:

* [Trick Questions](https://www.darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/trick-questions)
* [Sneak into Basket](https://www.darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/sneak-into-basket)
* [Privacy Zuckering](https://www.darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/privacy-zuckering)
* ...
 
So basically he has documented a lot of categories with real examples that make use of the actual UX theory and some of the [color psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_psychology) with the only goal of trick you into doing things that benefit their business instead of the users.

They also have a [Twitter timeline](https://twitter.com/darkpatterns) where they document what they call [the hall of shame](https://www.darkpatterns.org/hall-of-shame). And their full [list of the new hall of shame](https://airtable.com/shrGNWI3Wzu7spylj/tblXgQTTipdsp7V8L).

So that website actually inspired me to make my small effort to document:

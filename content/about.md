### About Me

My name is Jorge A. I come from a web software development background, I love new technology trends like Cloud Computing and Big Data, I'm also interested in Agile and DevOps culture.

Beyond technology, I'm deeply passionate about the arts. I work as an independent actor and independent filmmaker, exploring storytelling through both performance and direction. My other artistic interests include photography, painting, cinema and theatre.

I live in Mexico City, so if you're around you can always [ping me](/contact).

Other notable features are taxonomies, multilingual mode, image processing, custom output formats, HTML/CSS/JS minification and support for Sass SCSS workflows.
